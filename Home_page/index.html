        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="text"> 
            Hello, I'm Steven Zhu! I'm currently a 2A student studying in the Honours Math program at the University of Waterloo. 
             </p>
        <p class="text"> Being enrolled in UWaterloo has exposed me to a wide range of intriguing Math and Computer Science courses that have further motivated me to continue developing my interest in these fields.</p> 

        <p class="text"> As a math enthusiast, I have always been fascinated by the power of numbers and their ability to help solve complex problems in various fields. I enjoy challenging myself to find elegant solutions to difficult problems, and my studies at UWaterloo have allowed me to do just that.
        </p>

                <h3>Math Ambassador</h3>
                <p> As a Math Ambassador, I was able to share my passion for mathematics with others and inspire them to pursue their own interests in the field. </p>
                <p> During my 1b term of study, I took on this role and volunteered in various events, such as the March Break Campus Tour. This involved introducing prospective students to the University of Waterloo's campus and highlighting the active learning environment that is fostered here.
                </p>
                <p> One of the things I love most about being a Math Ambassador is the opportunity to give back to the community and inspire others to learn more about this fascinating subject. Whether I'm giving a presentation to a group of high school students or chatting with a curious parent at a university fair, I always feel energized by the chance to share my enthusiasm for mathematics.

                <h3>Newcomers' Orientation Welcome(NOW) Club Exec</h3>
                <p> During high school, I was one of the executives in the Newcomers Orientation Club. As the Newcomer’s Club executive, I strive to help newcomer students adapt to the new environment. </p>
                <p>Other executives and I hosted two Newcomers’ orientation weeks in the past summers, where two school boards set up a welcoming meeting for more than 200 students to introduce their schools briefly.</p> 

                    In my role as an executive member, I played a crucial part in planning and executing these events. I helped to coordinate the schedules, liaise with school board representatives, and ensure that all activities were carried out smoothly. It was truly rewarding to see new students feel more comfortable and confident in their new environment as a result of our efforts.
